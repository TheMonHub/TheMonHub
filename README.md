- ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m **Mono (TheMonHub)**. At 15, I'm a self-taught, **perfectionist C++ programmer from Thailand**, driven by pure passion.
- ðŸ‘€ My interest lies in unraveling the complexities of software, and building robust foundations. I've progressed from high-level game development to the intricate world of system-level programming.
- âœ¨ My focus right now is **LumiFramework**, my debut C++ project. It's a modular, cross-platform library designed to streamline desktop application development by eliminating boilerplate and providing deep developer control. **You better use that. Now.**
