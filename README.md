Howdy-? I'm a 15 years old programmer from Thai. You can call me **Mono**. My online handle is **TheMonHub**.

I started programming since I was like.. 9 or more maybe? I forgot ;-; -but it was with [`Scratch`](https://scratch.mit.edu)

Of course. Don't expect me to just code when I was 9, Of course it's Scratch. 

Without Scratch I would not be interested in this path.

Enough backstory, Hey! Do you know I can code in multiple languages?

- lua
  - luau (roblox lua)
  - LÃ–VE2D
- C-family
  - C (the original itself)
  - C++
  - C#
- Assembly
  - NASM

That's a lot (6 languages)... Anyway, I do stuff by passion and I learn by myself + a bit of AI.

 ### Other skills

I can also draw, and animate both in 3D and 2D. It's pretty decent or maybe just good but I'm just not sure :/
 
I can also do a simple model and rigging but It's pretty bad No deformation because my topology is dogshit. I usually do low poly style with floating limbs

I can do music too... Mostly.. Usually remix or something similar. Though I can't really think or come up with some melody or music by my own. So It's safe to say this is my worst trade.

 ### AI?? me no like u!
 
I might use AI but me no vibe code. I just use AI to search stuff for me or teach stuff or tell me something I don't know. Though I usually ended have to go through specifications or documentation. which make me questions why do I even use AI. maybe just to chat with because I'm lonely?

 My skills are genuine. Without AI I can still code and such.
