Howdy-? I'm a 15-year-old programmer from Thailand. You can call me **Mono**. My online handle is **TheMonHub**.

I started programming since I was like. 9 or more maybe? I forgot ;-; -but it was with [`Scratch`](https://scratch.mit.edu)

Of course. Don't expect me to just code when I was 9, Of course it's Scratch.

Without Scratch, I would not be interested in this path.

Enough backstory, Hey! Do you know I can code in multiple languages?

- lua
  - Luau (Roblox Lua)
  - LÖVE2D
- C-family
  - C
  - C++
  - C# Unity
- Assembly
  - NASM

That's a lot (6 languages)... Anyway, I do stuff by passion, and I learn by myself + a bit of AI.

### Other skills

I can also draw and animate both in 3D and 2D. It's pretty decent or maybe just good, but I'm just not sure :/

I can also do a simple model and rigging, but It's pretty bad No deformation because my topology is dogshit. I usually do low poly style with floating limbs

I can do music too... Mostly. Usually remix or something similar. Though I can't really think or come up with some melody or music of my own. So It's safe to say this is my worst trade.

### AI?? me no like u!

I might use AI but me no vibe code. I just use AI to search stuff for me or teach stuff or tell me something I don't know. Though I usually ended having to go through specifications or documentation. Which makes me question why I even use AI. Maybe just to chat with because I'm lonely? Lmao.

My skills are genuine. Without AI, I can still code and such.
